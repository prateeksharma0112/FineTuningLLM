<br>
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the project "Fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) for Code Generation". This project is part of the course "Engineering with Generative AI" at RPTU Kaiserslautern during the Winter Semester 2023-24. This repository contains all the necessary files and documentation to understand and reproduce our work on fine-tuning language models for Python code generation tasks.
